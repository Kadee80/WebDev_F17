# MixItUp.js 101

This example will begin with a simple MixItUp example from thier tutorial section. We will then use the docs together to layer in more complexity such as advanced filtering logic, sorting, and cusomization via thier API.

I highly reccomend taking a moment to go through thier getting started tutorial online if you wish to apply Mix It Up to an exisiting gallery/project.
