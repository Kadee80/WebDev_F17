# Portfolio Gallery Page

Letâ€™s take the images we just created, cropped and optimized and start making some gallery/portfolio style examples.

This example will use:

* [Image Optimization with Photoshop](../../Week_6/Photoshop/)

* [Transitions](../../Week_4/CSS3_Transforms_Transitions/)

* [Postioning](../../Week_3/Positioning/)

* [996 Grid Framework](../../Week_6/996_Grid/)

If you are still unclear on any of these topics, now is the time to review class examples and notes before moving on to a new topic.
