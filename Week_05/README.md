# Midterm Proposal Presentation Schedule

### Midterm Project is 25% of your final grade.

Midterm Presentations will take place Week 8.

Today you will be presenting your midterm proposals to your classmates. Please be respectful of your fellow students and keep your laptops closed while listening to presentations. Each presentation should take 3-5 minutes including questions and comments. Presentations will be timed in order to accomodate all studented within one class period.

** All proposals are due the first class of Week 5. We will be using a simple javascript function to shuffle your names and choose presentation order at the beginning of class so be prepared! **

#Presentation Schedule [TBD]

If you have not done so already, please be sure to email me your documentation/proposal link along with a link to your HW repo.


#HW - Begin building out your midterm site.

Start by building out a functional wireframe with HTML and CSS. If you are still struggling with layout concepts such as block float and inline-block, next weeks tutorial on 996 Grid Framework will be helpful. You can review class notes on this [here](../Week_6/996_Grid).

Remember, I am available for office hours before class on Mondays and Wednesdays and after class Tuesdays and Thursdays. If you have a question, I'm here to help. Please email me to schedule an office hour appointment with your questions/code ahead of time.
